# nRF551822-Remake

The goal of this project is to make revisions on the Nordic nRF51822 Beacon design for Toys2Life LLC. 
We are working in KiCad to design schematic and layout.
After searching for ways to edit the Altium Files provided by Nordic in KiCad, 
we decided to brute force the process and remake everything ourselves. 


The desired changes to the Beacon are: 
  -A larger battery
  -A wake on movement system
  -A Zener Diode for surge protection
